                <p>
                    <p>Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. During his birth, lightning struck during a
                        summer
                        storm. Born to a Serbian
                        Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. That said, his mother replied
                        to
                        that comment by calling him <i>Child of the light</i>.
                        He was born based on the conventional Slavonic rites, and his birth records show he was born on
                        <time>July 28th</time> .
                        Tesla was the fourth child in a family of five children.
                        The family comprised of three sisters including Marica, Angelina, Milka and his old brother who was
                        known as
                        Dane. Dane died when Tesla was still at a tender age.
                        Tesla attended his early education in <time>1861</time> in Smiljan, where he acquired various skills
                        including arithmetic
                        and he also mastered the German Language. The following year,
                        Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Gospic. Here, his father played the role of a Parish Pastor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tesla Said that <i>Contact with nature Made him Stronger both physically & mentally</i>. He read many
                        books while in tomingaj and
                        later said that mark twain's works had helped him to miraculously trcover from his earlier illness.</p>
                    <p>
                        By the time Nikola Tesla was six years old, he had already started experimenting and inventing. His keen
                        interest in nature and the way things work, combined with intelligence and curiosity, led to childhood
                        inventions such as a motor powered by June bugs, air piston gun, and frog catching device. In elementary
                        school he built water turbines and dreamed of using Niagara Falls to generate power, a dream that he saw
                        come to life in 1896. As a young man, Tesla excelled in his studies of math, physics, engineering, and
                        science. At one of his first jobs at the Budapest Telephone Exchange, Tesla improved the equipment and
                        developed an amplifier; soon after, while working at another job installing lights in Paris, Tesla made
                        improvements to Edison’s dynamos and created an automatic regulator.</p>
                    <p>
                        Upon reaching America in 1884 at the age of 28, Tesla continued developing his concepts and applied for
                        his first patent in 1888. He continued inventing and by the time of his death in 1943, Nikola Tesla held
                        almost 300 patents. Tesla’s lifelong dedication to harnessing the forces of nature for the benefit of
                        humanity is a legacy that continues to benefit the world today.</p>

                <p>
                    Tesla's Brush With Death Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high school. Three years later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after his arrival; he contracted cholera. He was in hospital for close to one year, and he faced near-death circumstances. 
                </p>
                <h3>1875</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Enrolls In College In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams. More so, he also started a cultural club and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the Technical Department. During his second year, he got into an argument with one his professors over the functionality of the Gramme dynamo. 
                </p>
                <h3>1880</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Moves To Prague To Study Philosophy Tesla’s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to finish his studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in Philosophy at the university, though he did not receive grades for the courses.
                </p>
                <h3>1881</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Begins His Career As Chief Electrical Engineer In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the position of chief electrical engineer. During his tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which improved the performance of the company. 
                </p>
                <h3>1882</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Goes To Work For Edison In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison Company. He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had several divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting systems. At this company, he improved his electrical engineering prowess. The management team noticed his abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos and motors. Following this, Tesla moved to New York in the USA. In 1884, one of his managers from Paris was relocated to the US to manage a company where he worked. During, this time, Tesla started a manufacturing division that was found in New York and sought for Tesla to be relocated to the country as well. In the same year, Tesla was relocated to the USA and started working immediately.

                <h3>1885</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Submits Some Of His First Patents In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the submission of various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane. They agreed to help finance a new light production company under Tesla Name. Tesla worked to acquire the patents for the company including developing an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from the mass media who sought his solutions. 
                </p>
                <h3>1887</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Re-imagines The Electric Motor In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits, especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the motor was operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric motor was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting design that did not require the use of commutators. As a result, this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high maintenance that was associated with replacing mechanical brushes

                <h3>1890</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless Power Transmission After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying to come up with new solutions for lighting

                <h3>1891</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla Patents The Tesla Coil In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of the US. In the same year, he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.
                </p>
                <h3>1943</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla's Death In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He died alone, and his body was found by a maid who ignored a do not disturb sign on Tesla’s room. The assistant medical professional evaluated the body and determined the cause of death was related to coronary complications. A few days after the FBI ordered for the acquisition of his belongings, John G Trump was called in to evaluate his works. Trump was a well known electrical engineer who worked for the state, which was held in custody. Following a three day investigation, a Trumps report concluded that was nothing that would demonstrate a hazard in unfriendly circumstances.

                <h2 id="#">INVENTIONS</h2>
                <h3>AC Power (alternating current)</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    When Tesla came to the United States, he worked for Thomas Edison in Manhattan and was promised $50,000 if he could make Edison’s direct current method successful. As it turned out, Edison’s DC current was not as effective as Tesla’s own alternating current method in transmitting electricity over long distances. When Edison reneged on his offer to pay Tesla to solve his DC power design flaws, Tesla quit and moved on to his next endeavor.
                    He applied for many patents for his AC power discoveries which were later sold to Westinghouse. AC power has been widely used since its discovery and still has some applications in radio and television transmission.
                </p>
                <h3>Tesla Coil</h3>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most familiar symbol of Tesla’s work is the Tesla coil, embodied in the tower that was erected at what is now the last remaining laboratory located in Shoreham, New York, the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe. Here, Tesla created a tower topped by his infamous coils which shot electric sparks through the air and circulated the electricity around the coils by alternating current. 
                </p>
                <h3>Magnifying Transmitter</h3>
                <p>
                    Building upon the revelations of the Tesla coil, Tesla sought to offer wireless power for free to all by transmitting information from one tower to another using resonance. The currents were sent from one circuit to the other, building in frequency until lightning sparked from one tower to the other. By connecting a wire to the tower and running it around his lab, he powered his laboratory wirelessly. He demonstrated the effect on stage to audiences using light bulbs that were not connected to any power source. The magnifying transmitter succeeded in transmitting an electrical current a kilometer away.
                </p>
                <h3>Tesla Turbine</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla developed a piston engine to power automobiles using combustion to rotate disks. At the time, commonly used turbines were less efficient and relied on blades. Tesla’s invention merged many disks to create a centrifugal pump. By moving fluid in the path of least resistance, his turbine was more fuel-efficient. His turbine is also known as “…the boundary-layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine, and Prandtl-layer turbine it uses the boundary-layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.” (Wikipedia)<br>
                    Smooth disks with nozzles circulate fluid around the edge of the disk. As the disk spins, the fluid adheres to the edge of the disk and is drawn from the edge of disk to the center. It works by adhesion rather than friction, resulting in greater efficiency.                     
                </p>
                <h3>Shadowgraph</h3>
                <p>
                    The Shadowgraph is another name for x-rays, but Tesla’s term is actually more depictive of the process. An x-ray creates a silhouette of the area captured by passing radioactive waves through the human body. Although the invention was initially developed by Rontgen, Tesla made improvements to the technique to render clearer images.
                </p>
                <h3>Radio</h3>
                <p>
                    Before his lab burned down, Tesla was working on developing a radio intended to transmit a signal fifty miles. Prior to its completion, however, another gentleman received a patent for a similar radio design in England. Had he succeeded, Nikola Tesla’s invention would have surpassed the Brit’s invention in strength. 
                </p>
                <h3>Neon Lamp</h3>
                <p>
                    The neon lamp (or sign) was Tesla’s modification of existing neon light technology to form words and designs. Neon signs continue to exist worldwide, lighting up bars, casinos, hotels, and other signs along the roadway. 
                </p>
                <h3>Hydroelectric Power</h3>
                <p>
                    The Niagara Falls Commission selected Tesla to design the hydroelectric power generator at Niagara Falls using his alternating power technology. Considered the first power plant, Tesla’s technology was used throughout the world to provide electricity to the masses.
                </p>
                <h3>Induction Motor</h3>
                <p>
                    Using electromagnets to spin, Tesla’s induction motor currently powers everyday household items such as vacuums, hairdryers and power tools.
                </p>
                <h3>Radio Controlled Boat</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla used radio transmission to power the first radio-controlled toy boat, controlling its engine, lighting and steering with a remote control. Today’s drones are based on this technology. While some viewed his invention as a contribution to warfare, i.e. torpedoes, Tesla considered it the beginning of robotic technology which would eventually handle the majority of labor for man.
                    Many of Nikola Tesla’s inventions went unrecognized, others lost when his notes were destroyed by fire. At the end of his life, his research was confiscated by the FBI, and only in recent years has it been made available to the public.

                <h2 id="#">FACT'S ABOUT TESLA</h2>
                <h3>The shock of his brother’s death affected his personality</h3>
                <p>
                    The defining moment in Tesla`s life was when he came across the death of his sibling. His death occurred during a riding accident and the years following this were traumatic for Tesla. In fact, he at one point mentioned he could see visions of the air around him `packed with flames of fire.` As an adolescent, he learnt to control his visions but would spend most of his time feeding and communicating with pigeons.
                </p>
                <h3>Tesla was once digging trenches for a living</h3>
                <p>
                    Following his graduation from the state university, Tesla got a job with the local electrical company in Paris. However, he relocated later on in 1884, with the goal of working for Edison. Edison at the time was a prominent name when it came to technological innovations. Tesla quickly rose up the heights at the Edison Company, and he subsequently got a job as an engineer. Edison claimed to give a $50,000 reward for an improvement to his DC generator design. Tesla worked hard to come up with an alternative, but Edinson refused to pay up and Tesla lost his job. While Tesla searched for financiers for his project, he was forced to dig trenches to earn a living.
                </p>
                <h3>He discovered x rays with assistance from Mark Twain</h3>
                <p>
                    Twain and Tesla become close compatriots in the early 18901. He received support from Mark Twain who had a lifelong obsession with new inventions and technologies as well. One day, while visiting Tesla`s lab, Twain decided to take photos that were lit by incandescent light. In 1895, Tesla and a well knew photograph her invited Twain in the lab to take a picture. This one was operated by an electrical device that was known as a Crookes tube. When Tesla reviews the resulting photograph negative, he determined that it was rather splotchy and therefore ruined. A few weeks later, he and another famous German Scientist known as Rontigen unveiled what is nowadays referred to as X-rays.  
                </p>
                <h3>He developed a remote-controlled boat for military purposes</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Spanish American war that occurred in 1898, one of Tesla`s main projects was a small boat that could control through wireless signals. When he applied for the patent for the technology, the state did not believe it was functional and therefore sent their staff. Tesla did well to demonstrate his technology to the staff, and various other big names. This included J.P Morgan who was the financier of various estates. Tesla also informed a local news media that his invention would make it simple for battles to be fought without losing lives. This would render warfare useless, and this was one of his main goals. Today you can find similar technology in a wide range of technologies, such as the remotes for your TV, electric skateboards, adult electric scooters, self balancing scooters and electric unicycles.
                </p>
                <h3>His claims of signals received from space were legitimate</h3>
                <p>
                    During the summer of 1899, Tesla set up a lab in Colorado Springs. The station was a high altitude station that was to be used to transmit information and electrical resources over long distances. One day, while tracking the lightning storms, his equipment came across certain beeps. After determining that Solar and terrestrial factors were not the cause, he came to the conclusion that the signals came from another planet. On the following Christmas, Tesla informed the world that there was a message from an unknown world. However, a 1996 study copying Teslas experiment showed that the signal was caused by the moon passing through Jupiter. 
                </p>
                <h3>The famous Stanford White designed his lab</h3>
                <p>
                    J.P Morgan was one of the main financiers of Teslas projects. In fact, in 1901, he convinced Morgan to release an average of $150,000 for a new business venture. This was a powerful station that was based at Wardenclyffe, on the northern section of LonDuring the summer of 1899, Tesla set up a lab in Colorado Springs. The station was a high altitude station that was to be used to transmit information and electrical resources over long distances. One day, while tracking the lightning storms, his equipment came across certain beeps. After determining that Solar and terrestrial factors were not the cause, he came to the conclusion that the signals came from another planet. On the following Christmas, Tesla informed the world that there was a message from an unknown world. However, a 1996 study copying Teslas experiment showed that the signal was caused by the moon passing through Jupiter.g Island. The role of the of the station would be the new location where Tesla would work on his long-distance communication resources. It is here where Stanford white was hired to design his laboratory. He was a long time friend of Tesla, and they design a lab features a giant 180-foot tower. The tower was designed to act as a transmitter, and it was also linked to underground horizontal pipes.

                <h3>His relationship with J.P Morgan was not stable</h3>
                <p>
                    When financing for the Wardenclyffe project ran out, Tesla tried to ask for additional funding for the project, but he failed. While some theorists believe the Morgan cut out funding because Tesla planned to provide wireless power, his other key concern was getting caught up with radio projects. In 1903, after being denied funds by Morgan, Tesla closed up the project. The following year, he wrote accusing Morgan of being a Muslim follower.

                <h3>He spent his last years in isolation</h3>
                <p>
                    While for a long time Tesla was one of the big names in New York, poverty and age ultimately led to his death. He lived in isolation in various hotels, and he often preferred the company of pigeons. However, he remembered one aspect of his days as a showman, in the form of press conferences that were to be organised each year. After turning 79 in the same year, he announced that he was inventing a small-sized oscillator that had the power to destroy any military forces.
